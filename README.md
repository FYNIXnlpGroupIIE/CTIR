# CTIR (Learning Class-Transductive Intent Representations for Zero-shot Intent Detection)
Here is the implementation of our IJCAI-2021 [Learning Class-Transductive Intent Representations for Zero-shot Intent Detection](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.01721.pdf).
This repository contains code modified from [here for CapsNet+CTIR](https://github.com/nhhoang96/ZeroShotCapsule-PyTorch-), [here for ZSDNN+CTIR](https://github.com/xuandif-cmu/Zero-shot-DNN) and [here for +LOF+CTIR](https://github.com/thuiar/DeepUnkID), many thanks!
